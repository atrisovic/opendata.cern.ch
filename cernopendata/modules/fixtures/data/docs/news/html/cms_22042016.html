<p>Today, the CMS Collaboration at CERN has released more than <a href="/search?page=1&size=20&q=run2011a%20cms">300 terabytes (TB) of high-quality open data</a>. These include over 100 TB, or 2.5 inverse femtobarns (fb−1), of data from proton collisions at 7 TeV, making up half the data collected at the LHC by the CMS detector in 2011. This follows a previous release from November 2014, which made available around 27 TB of research data collected in 2010.</p>
<p>Available on the CERN Open Data Portal — which is built in collaboration with members of CERN’s IT Department and Scientific Information Service — the collision data are released into the public domain under the CC0 waiver and come in types: The so-called <a href="/search?page=1&size=20&q=cms%20primary%20dataset">'primary datasets'</a> are in the same format used by the CMS Collaboration to perform research. The <a href="/search?page=1&size=20&q=cms%20derived%20dataset">'derived datasets'</a> on the other hand require a lot less computing power and can be readily analysed by university or high-school students, and CMS has provided a limited number of datasets in this format. <a href="https://cms.cern/news/cms-releases-new-batch-research-data-lhc">Read full release announcement</a></p>
